# Deep learning and AdS/CFT
In `ML` folder, there are two seperated folders: `my code` and `koji's code`, which were from the author of the paper.
* My code is construced with tensorflow.
* koji's code is constructed with pytorch, which can be founded in github too.

`BH` stands for black hole metric prediction, `MH` for magnetic response of M-H relation in strongly correlated material, and `QCD` for holographic QCD.
